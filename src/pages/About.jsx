              Exploring the world, forging meaningful connections, and immersing myself in melodies inspire me. Coffee keeps me energized, while training keeps me grounded.

                I am currently studying at Chas Academy in Stockholm. I have always been interested in design and often come
                up with creative solutions. That's why I decided to enter the world of UX/UI design, which has been one of
                my best decisions.

            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Additionally, I have a strong interest in coding, but at the moment, I am more focused on UX and UI design.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Let's collaborate and create delightful experiences together!</span>
